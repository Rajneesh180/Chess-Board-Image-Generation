# Chess Board Image Generation ♟️

This project generates a simple chessboard pattern using Python and OpenCV. It uses NumPy to create an image with white squares on a black background, simulating a chessboard layout. This is a great way to visualize chessboard patterns programmatically.

## 📸 Features:

* **Chessboard Creation**: Automatically generates a chessboard pattern.
* **Resizable**: You can adjust the size of the board by modifying the size of the image.
* **Display**: Displays the generated chessboard using OpenCV.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup:

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Chess-Board-Image-Generation.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   You will need Python 3.x and the following libraries:

   * OpenCV
   * NumPy

   Install them using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   Simply run the Python script to generate and display the chessboard image:

   ```bash
   python chessboard_image.py
   ```

4. **Display Chessboard**:
   The generated chessboard will be displayed in an OpenCV window. Press any key to close the window.

## 🎨 How it Works:

* The script creates a black canvas using NumPy and fills specific regions of the image with white color to simulate the squares of a chessboard.
* The image is then displayed using OpenCV's `imshow` function.

## 💾 Save Your Work:

The current version does not include a feature to save the image, but it can be easily added by using OpenCV's `imwrite` function if needed.
